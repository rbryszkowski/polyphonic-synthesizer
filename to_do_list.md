# TO DO

Note: Since I'm going to be using the word 'keyboard' and 'key' alot, which could be misinterpreted as the whole of, or part of the synth itself, assume that 'keyboard' and 'key' refer to COMPUTER keyboard. If I am referring to the synth I will say 'synth' and 'note' and not 'keyboard' or 'key'. This duplicate terminology is proving rather annoying, especially as I will also be mentioning musical keys (scales), so hopefully knowing this will avoid alot of confusion.

## immediate:

- add more octaves, chords start on middle octave, same as notes (can move to higher lower octave with assigned keys)
- improve style and layout
- add ability to move up/down an octave with assigned keys
- allow user to track which octave they are on by visually accenting the octave (e.g. by placing a border around the octave)
- hovering over a note (without clicking) will highlight the note in a subtle colour and display the note name (with octave number), clicking on the note will highlight it in a darker colour (still displaying the note name).
- add more scales and chords


## future features:

- add an effects selector
- add a synth selector
- add a musical key selector for chords, consisting of a root-note selector and a scale selector
  - add an option for randomly generated chords
- add ability to flatten/sharpen chords with assigned keys
- add ability to switch a chord from major/minor with assigned keys
- add ability to move up/down an octave with assigned keys
- add a drum/sample pad with keyboard control, with ability to import custom samples
